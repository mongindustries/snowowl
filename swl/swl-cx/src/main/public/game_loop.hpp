/**
 * A game loop construct.
 *
 * A game loop manages game/app execution by executing two functions,
 * namely update and render on an infinite loop.
 *
 * A game loop has an update tick that is time-consistent given a
 * <code>target_frame_rate</code> and a <code>bail_amount</code>. Bail
 * amount is used in the off chance that a frame has been delayed far
 * too long (due to the game loop's execution blocked by a long render
 * operation or the game loop is waiting for the next frame to be notified
 * by another thread.
 *
 * A game loop executes the two methods in a separate thread. This ensures
 * that the event thread by the OS is not interfered in any way and event
 * pumping is consistent. This helps with input latency by separately processing
 * input stuff on another thread.
 *
 * To define a event loop like app loop, define an arbitrary frame rate and set
 * bail amount to 1.
 *
 * A game loop's frame can also be manually executed by calling the <code>frame</code>
 * method. But be sure to block the game thread first by setting <code>check_for_lock</code>
 * to true.
 *
 * To start a game loop, call the <code>open</code> method. To close it, call the <code>close</code>
 * method. Be sure to wait for game loop frame execution completion by doing a <code>wait</code>
 * call on <code>target</code> lock.
 *
